    My task was design and implementation of component for scxml to voicexml
    transformation (scxml2vxml for short). It is the part of the system whose
    responsibility is outputing voicexml file containing the dialogue from
    input scxml file in voicexml format. This component depends on the SRGS
    grammar extraction/creation component.

            Grammar reference can not be obtained from the scxml directly as it is possible that the source scxml file contains inline grammars. 
            In such case it is responsibility of other parts of the system to extract these grammars into a separate file to which it then
            provides reference. At any rate, scxml2vxml relies on the client to provide any grammar referrences required and does not handle 
            parsing of grammar info from the scxml file in any way. Originally XPath was used to to find target fields for these grammar references.
            Eventually though, after transitioning to jdom2 library, it has been decided to append the referrences as part of transformation of each
            individual voicexml field at the time of creating it from scxml state. This way the component handles its task in single passage making 
            it more efficient and easier to maintain as the fields are created atomically.

            <p>
            Since voicexml fields execute in sequential order, information from scxml transitions had to be retained in some way. This was achieved 
            using the clear voicexml element. Fields are created in same order as the states appear in the input. Already visited states are remembered
            and every time there is a transition 'backwards', that is to an already visited state, a conditional structure containing the clear is created
            targeting this state, effectively moving the dialogue backwards to the old field.

            Originally SAX was used to read each individual scxml state, the data was stored in an intermediate format and rendered into a voicexml field
            using simple DOM API. This approach was later abandoned as most of the code was creating the same structure every time. Moreover the code was 
            hard to read as it required a lot of boilerplate to create and append elements, set attribute values etc. Thus XSL transformation has been used 
            instead to create the common skeleton of each field to which dynamic information like grammar reference and navigation control using the clear
            elements is added from java code.

        Whole dialogue is kept in a single form element. It is split into a series of questions and responses from the user, eoch of these represented
        by one field element. The first field in the conversation is in special element called initial instead of field, all else remains the same.
        The field can contain prompt elements which specify what the interpreter should tell to or ask the user. It then contains element filled which
        specifies what happens when the user provides some input. If there is no input or the input can not be understood by the interpreter, content of
        noinput and nomatch elements is invoked respectively. In our case default behavior of both nomatch an and noinput is to terminate the dialogue
        after three unsuccesfull inputs. Further each field can contain referrence to a grammar which is used to match the user input. Lastly the field can
        contain clear elements to navigate the dialogue as described in the Dialogue Navigation section above.
